                       Watch on-demand sessions from the NVIDIA GTC global AI conference to catch up on recent breakthroughs in robotics, showcased by leading experts in the field.
                       In his keynote, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang announced NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1, the worldâ€™s first open, fully customizable foundation model for generalized humanoid robot reasoning and skills.  He also introduced Newton, an open-source, extensible physics engine being developed by NVIDIA, Google DeepMind and Disney Research to advance robot learning and development.
                       This year at GTC, NVIDIA hosted in-person training labs for robotics developers, which are now available online.  They include:
                       Develop, Simulate and Deploy Robot Intelligence With Scaled Foundations
                       Generating High-Quality Motion Data for Robotics With MobilityGen
                       Software-in-the-Loop Testing for Robots With OpenUSD, Isaac Sim and ROS <br>
                       These courses will be available soon: <br>

                       Accelerating ROS 2 With NVIDIA GPU-Powered Libraries and AI Models <br>
                       NVIDIA also released a free, open-source physical AI dataset comprising commercial-grade, pre-validated data to help researchers and developers kickstart their projects.  The initial dataset offers 15 terabytes of data representing more than 320,000 trajectories for robotics training and 1,000 Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD) assets, including those that are SimReady. <br>
                     Scaled Foundations Streamlines the Transition From Simulation to Real-World Application ðŸ”—
                     Robots have the potential to automate and scale difficult and repetitive tasks.  However, programming robots to perform these tasks safely has traditionally been challenging, costly and specialized.  Scaled Foundations, a member of the NVIDIA Inception program for cutting-edge startups, is lowering the barrier to entry with its GRID platform. <br>
                     By integrating NVIDIA Isaac Sim into GRID, Scaled Foundations provides users with an opportunity to fast-track the development and deployment of advanced robotic AI solutions across new robot types.  Students and developers can use a browser to access cutting-edge tools for building, testing, and deploying robot AI systems. Spotlight on Wheeled Lab: Advancing Simulation-to-Reality Robotics With NVIDIA Isaac Lab ðŸ”—
                     Wheeled Lab, a research project from the University of Washington, is bringing simulation-to-reality robotics to low-cost, open-source platforms. <br>
                       Wheeled Lab, integrated with NVIDIA Isaac Lab â€” a unified framework for robot learning â€” enables reinforcement learning models to train wheeled robots for complex tasks like controlled drifting, obstacle avoidance, elevation traversal and visual navigation.  End-to-end learning, domain randomization, and sensor simulation are used in this pipeline to ensure zero-shot simulation-to-reality transfer between simulated training and real-world deployment.<br>
